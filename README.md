# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project repository! This repository documents my journey in learning Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). It includes all the packages, functions, libraries, and initial projects that I have worked on. This repository is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in ML/DL, from beginners to advanced practitioners.
